# FSBrowser

FSBrowser is simple desktop interface for Hadoop Distributed File System. 
The application can be used as a more efficient alternative to Hue's file browser. 
It uses native hadoop libraries instead of HttpFS and should be faster for reading and writing directories with large number of files.
